// Coding Exercise 25: Managing Flour Pack Requirements With Limited Bucket Sizes
/*
Calculate how many buckets of flour are needed to fulfill a goal weight, respecting big and small bag constraints.
 */

/**
 * Write a method named canPack with three parameters of type int named bigCount, smallCount, and goal.
 *
 * The parameter bigCount represents the count of big flour bags (5 kilos each).
 *
 * The parameter smallCount represents the count of small flour bags (1 kilo each).
 *
 * The parameter goal represents the goal amount of kilos of flour needed to assemble a package.
 *
 * Therefore, the sum of the kilos of bigCount and smallCount must be at least equal to the value of goal.
 * The method should return true if it is possible to make a package with goal kilos of flour.
 *
 * If the sum is greater than goal, ensure that only full bags are used towards the goal amount.
 * For example, if goal = 9, bigCount = 2, and smallCount = 0, the method should return false since
 * each big bag is 5 kilos and cannot be divided.
 *
 * However, if goal = 9, bigCount = 1, and smallCount = 5, the method should return true because of 1 full bigCount bag and 4 full smallCount bags equal goal,
 * and it's okay if there are additional bags left over.
 *
 * If any of the parameters are negative, return false.
 *
 * canPack (1, 0, 4); should return false since bigCount is 1 (big bag of 5 kilos) and goal is 4 kilos.
 *
 * canPack (1, 0, 5); should return true since bigCount is 1 (big bag of 5 kilos) and goal is 5 kilos.
 *
 * canPack (0, 5, 4); should return true since smallCount is 5 (small bags of 1 kilo) and goal is 4 kilos, and we have 1 bag left which is ok as mentioned above.
 *
 * canPack (2, 2, 11); should return true since bigCount is 2 (big bags 5 kilos each) and smallCount is 2 (small bags of 1 kilo), makes in total 12 kilos and goal is 11 kilos.
 *
 * canPack (-3, 2, 12); should return false since bigCount is negative.
