# üìö Section 5: Expression Statements ‚Äî Java Coding Exercises

## üìù Overview

This section focuses on strengthening foundational Java programming skills through a series of **12 hands-on coding exercises**.  
Each exercise introduces a key concept such as **expressions**, **statements**, **method creation**, 
**boolean logic**, **mathematical operations**, **conditional structures**, and **input validation**.
