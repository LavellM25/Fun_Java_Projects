# Exercise 2: 🚗 Speed Converter: Kilometers per Hour to Miles per Hour

## 📝 Overview

This Java program converts a given speed from **kilometers per hour (km/h)** to **miles per hour (mi/h)**.  
It is designed as a beginner-level exercise to practice **expressions**, **method creation**, **mathematical calculations**, and **conditional logic** in Java.

## 🛠️ How It Works

- The program contains two methods:
    - **`toMilesPerHour(double kilometersPerHour)`**:  
      Converts kilometers per hour to miles per hour. Returns `-1` if the input is invalid (negative).
    - **`printConversion(double kilometersPerHour)`**:  
      Prints the conversion result in a readable format or shows `"Invalid Value"` if the input is negative.
- The `main` method can be used to test both methods with different inputs.

## 🚀 Sample Output

### Example 1:
```java
System.out.println(toMilesPerHour(1.5));
// Output: 1
