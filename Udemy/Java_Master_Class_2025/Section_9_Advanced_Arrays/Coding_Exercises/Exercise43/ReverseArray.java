/** Pseudocode:
 * 1. Print the array (original order):
 *     - Print "Array = " followed by the array elements
 *
 * 2. Set two pointers:
 *     - One pointer (start) at the beginning of the array (index 0)
 *     - One pointer (end) at the end of the array (last index)
 *
 * 3. While start is less than end:
 *     a. Save the value at start index into a temporary variable
 *     b. Replace the value at start index with the value at end index
 *     c. Replace the value at end index with the value saved in temporary variable
 *     d. Move start pointer one step forward
 *     e. Move end pointer one step backward
 *
 * 4. Print the array again (after reversing):
 *     - Print "Reversed array = " followed by the reversed array elements
