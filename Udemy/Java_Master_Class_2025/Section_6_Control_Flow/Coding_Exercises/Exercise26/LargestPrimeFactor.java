/** Identifying The Largest Prime Factor Of A Number
 Write a method named getLargestPrime with one parameter of type int named number.

 If the number is negative or does not have any prime numbers, the method should return -1 to indicate an invalid value.



 The method should calculate the largest prime factor of a given number and return it.



 EXAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT:

 getLargestPrime (21); should return 7 since 7 is the largest prime (3 * 7 = 21)

 getLargestPrime (217); should return 31 since 31 is the largest prime (7 * 31 = 217)

 getLargestPrime (0); should return -1 since 0 does not have any prime numbers

 getLargestPrime (45); should return 5 since 5 is the largest prime (3 * 3 * 5 = 45)

 getLargestPrime (-1); should return -1 since the parameter is negative



 HINT: Since the numbers 0 and 1 are not considered prime numbers, they cannot contain prime numbers.

        // STEP 5: After the loop, if number > 1, it itself is the largest prime
        // e.g., for 217, loop handles 7, and 31 is left â†’ 31 is prime
        // otherwise, the last saved 'factor' is the largest prime factor
