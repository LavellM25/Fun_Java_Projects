# Java Mastery: Section 6 - Control Flow

## 🎯 Overview
Section 6 of your Java learning journey focused on mastering **control flow**, a cornerstone of logical thinking in programming. Through 29 real-world exercises, you gained hands-on experience writing conditional statements, loops, and methods that solve practical problems — all while reinforcing **clean, reusable code design**.

This section emphasized how **simple logic can power complex behavior**, preparing you for more advanced Java topics. Here's a recap of what you've built and learned!

## 🧠 Core Concepts Practiced

### ✅ Conditionals
- `if`, `else`, and `else if`
- Compound conditions using `&&`, `||`
- Input validation and boundary checks

### 🔁 Loops
- `while`, `for`, and nested loops
- Loop control: break, continue
- Loop-based pattern generation (e.g., stars, digit reversals)

### 🔢 Math and Logic
- Modulo arithmetic (e.g., `number % 2 == 0` for even check)
- Prime factor detection
- Palindrome and perfect number logic
- Rounding with `Math.ceil()` and `Math.round()`

### 🔄 Method Skills
- Return values, input parameters
- Method overloading
- Static utility methods for reusability

### 🧪 Testing & Debugging
- Console output comparisons
- Step-by-step execution using sample inputs
- Breaking down complex problems into smaller helper methods

## 🚀 Projects and Scenarios Covered
Each coding exercise simulated a real-life or relatable problem:

| Exercise | Skill Highlight | Description |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|
| 13–15 | Odd/Even Checks | Identified and summed odd numbers in ranges |
| 16 | Palindrome | Checked if a number is the same forward and backward |
| 17–18 | Digit Manipulation | Extracted, reversed, summed specific digits |
| 19–20 | Shared Digits | Compared numbers for shared endings or values |
| 21–23 | Divisors & Primes | Factor listing, greatest common divisor, and perfect number checks |
| 24 | Number to Words | Converted integers to spoken form |
| 25 | Packaging Logic | Calculated bag counts with multiple constraints |
| 26 | Largest Prime Factor | Found the largest prime dividing a number |
| 27 | Pattern Printing | Built symmetrical star patterns with nested loops |
| 28 | Input Scanning | Took dynamic user input and calculated sum/average |
| 29 | Method Overloading | Used multiple versions of the same method for paint bucket logic |

## ✨ Highlights
- **Method Overloading**: Learned how the same method name can solve different problems by varying parameters — a real-world Java pattern used in libraries like `System.out.println()`.
- **Input Validation**: You implemented defensive coding strategies, returning `-1` or printing error messages when inputs were invalid.
- **Mathematical Reasoning**: You built logic for GCD, factor pairs, number reversal, and rounding — essential in data handling and algorithms.
- **Pattern Building**: You used nested loops creatively to generate visual outputs (like diagonal stars), reinforcing iteration thinking.

## 💼 Why This Matters
Control flow logic forms the core of **problem-solving with code**. Whether you're building a calculator, a game, or a backend system, being able to decide what your program should do and when is foundational. Section 6 showed you how to:

- Think like a developer
- Break big challenges into smaller, testable pieces
- Write clean, reusable, and reliable methods

## 📁 Next Steps
- Apply these skills in mini projects (e.g., ATM simulation, score calculators, command-line games)
- Refactor these solutions using OOP in future sections
- Add unit testing with JUnit for validation
